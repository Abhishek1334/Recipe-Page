## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Through creating a recipe page with a responsive layout, I learned how to implement Flexbox for the first time to create a flexible, user-friendly design. Using Flexbox, I gained a deeper understanding of how to align and distribute elements within a container efficiently, allowing for both horizontal and vertical alignment. I also learned the importance of designing a layout that adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizes, utilizing media queries to make the page responsive for both mobile and desktop views. By adjusting the flex properties and media query breakpoints, I ensured that the recipe page remains visually appealing and easy to navigate, regardless of the device. This project helped me enhance my skills in responsive design, layout structuring, and CSS Flexbox principles.
